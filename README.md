# OpenMUD

Mud is a text-based multiplayer game. I've been avid player of Polish one - Arkadia (arkadia.rpg.pl). But what I always found annoying in every one I've tried was strict division between players and coders/content creators. 

This project is an attempt to create open source mud - where every person with basic knowledge can create some 'locations' they would like to see, monster, quests or even create whole new mechanics, depending of they coding knowledge. Also every aspect of game mechanics will be transparent.

Every game needs a setting - I've choosen Warhammer 40k universe. Very rich, diverse, dark.. and one that have both magic AND spaceships :)
